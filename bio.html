    <h1>Nick Rifken Bio</h1>
    <hr>
<p>Nick Rifken is the kind of person who can talk API architecture and platform strategy in one breath, then switch to food stalls in Lima or live jazz in Brooklyn in the next. A natural connector of systems, people, and ideas, he’s spent the last several years helping platforms and partners speak the same technical language — often without needing a translator. At GetYourGuide, he leads connectivity across the Americas, where his days are a mix of integration launches, partner strategy, and troubleshooting the occasional mystery 500 error (usually with Datadog in one tab and a cold brew in the other).</p>
<p>Before stepping into the world of travel tech, Nick climbed the ranks at Thought Industries, where he helped build support and ops functions from the ground up. From onboarding teams and calming enterprise clients to co-writing bug processes with InfoSec, he learned how to navigate the wild world where product, engineering, and customer success collide. And somewhere along the way, he became the go-to person for getting stuff done without making it feel like a fire drill.</p>

With an MBA, a music degree (he’s a trained percussionist, no big deal), and a passport that’s seen better days, Nick brings rhythm, structure, and curiosity to everything he does. Whether he's mapping out API roadmaps, mentoring new hires, or leading a partner webinar with way too many GIFs, he believes tech should feel human — and that a little levity goes a long way.</p>
